# MinerMan

An arcade game, written for the Pico 8.

This game was inspired by Bomberman, for the NES: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman_(1983_video_game). And the original Rogue:

The goal of the game is to collect as many points as possible by killing blobs and reaching new levels. Each level consists of a dungeon with one of more sections. Each section contains a randomly generated collection of rocks, and enemies. Rocks can be blown up with the players bombs, and enemies are killed with bombs. A ladder to the next dungeon can be found underneath a random rock, or killing all of the enemies in the dungeon.

There are four powerups that can be found randomly while exploring the dungeons. The players speed can be increased, bomb recharge time can be decreased, bomb explosion spread can be increased and the number of bombs that can be dropped simultaneously can be increased. These powerups are stacked together, so the player grows more powerful the futher they get.
